            I&apos;m currently an Engineer at Upstatement building things for
            the web with some awesome people. <br />I recently graduated from
            Northeastern University after completing three awesome six-month
            co-ops at MullenLowe U.S., Starry, and Apple Music. As a software
            engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design â€”
            combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to
            create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications
            that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing
            engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences. When I&apos;m not in front
            of a computer screen, I&apos;m probably snowboarding, cruising
            around on my penny board, or crossing off another item on my bucket
            list.
